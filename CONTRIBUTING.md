## Additional Contributions

We welcome additional test cases for flow structure identifications such as vortices, uniform momentum zones, uniform concentration zones, turbulent-nonturbulent interfaces. These test cases can help to reach a universal segmentation model in fluid experiments.

In addition, we appreciate any additional snapshots for better fine-tuning of object detection in Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) or Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) experiments.

To contribute in these areas, you can contact us or submit a pull request with your test cases or snapshots. Please include a detailed description of your contribution. We look forward to your valuable contributions!

# Contributing to Flow Segmentation Project

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
So all code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!
